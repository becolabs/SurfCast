# Note on Data and Model Files:
# For this initial sprint, we are committing the small CSV data and the model file
# as they are the primary deliverables of the research phase.
# For larger-scale projects, data and large model files should be ignored.
# Example for the future:
# landing_zone/*.csv
# *.pkl
